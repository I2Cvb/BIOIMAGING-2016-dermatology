\noindent Malignant melanoma is the deadliest type of skin cancer, accounting for the vast majority of skin cancer deaths~\cite{CancerFactsFigures2014}. 
According to latest reports, melanoma causes over 20,000 deaths annually in Europe~\cite{forsea2012melanoma}. 
In 2014, the American Cancer Society also reported that the number of new diagnosed cases is 76,100 with 9710 estimated deaths~\cite{CancerFactsFigures2014}. 
%Nevertheless, early diagnosis play a key role since that melanoma being the most treatable kind of cancer.
Nevertheless, melanoma is the most treatable kind of cancer if diagnosed early. 

Melanoma is clinically diagnosed through visual inspection and deep analysis of the lesion, using clinical imaging techniques such as dermoscopic imaging.
The clinical diagnosis of early stage melanoma is commonly based on the ``ABCDE'' rule~\cite{abbasi2004early}, defined as Asymmetry, irregular Borders, variegated Colors, Diameters greater than \SI{6}{\milli \metre} and its Evolution over time. %ving stages over time.  
These inspections and analysis are challenging since, first different lesions such as melanoma and dysplastic nevi share similar characteristics in terms of ``ABCD'' and second the necessity to perform patient follow-up over the years.
Therefore, the research communities have dedicated their efforts to develop computerized lesion analysis algorithms for classification of melanoma lesions. 

When studying skin lesions, akin to other medical applications, the percentage of malignant cases is far less when compared with benign cases. 
This problem is frequently referred as ``class imbalance'' problem~\cite{prati2009data} and has been encountered in multiple areas such as telecommunication managements, bioinformatics, fraud detection, and medical diagnosis. 
Imbalanced data substantially compromises the learning process since most of the standard machine learning algorithms expect balanced class distribution or an equal misclassification cost~\cite{he2009learning}.

Medical data are prone to such drawbacks due to the fact that the portion of diseased samples or patients is far lower than healthy cases.
Furthermore, the detection and classification of minority malignant cases are highly essential so that the \ac{se} of developed algorithms need to be maximized.
Consequently, the problem of imbalanced data is usually addressed by employing different techniques which do not impair the topology of the data.
Despite the fact that classification of malignant melanoma has been extensively studied~\cite{rastgoo2015automatic}, up to our knowledge, only few works tackled the issue implied by imbalanced dataset~\cite{barata2013two,celebi2007methodological}.
Barata~\emph{et al.} generate new synthetic samples by adding a Gaussian noise with fixed parameters to the samples belonging to the minority class~\cite{barata2013two}.
Celebi~\emph{et al.} and Capdehourat~\emph{et al.} over-sampled their dataset using \ac{smote}~\cite{chawla2002smote} to improve the \ac{se} of their algorithm~\cite{celebi2007methodological, capdehourat2009pigmented}.

This paper provides an insight to the specific problem of classification of imbalanced dataset for malenoma. 
To proceed, we review different techniques proposed by the machine learning community and compile a comprehensive quantitative evaluation. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: an overview of the classification framework designed to investigate data balancing techniques is presented in Sect.\,\ref{sec:mm}.
The balancing strategies are explained in depth in Sect.\,\ref{sec:met} and the validation and classification are discussed in Sect.\,\ref{sec:clas-val}.
A quantitative evaluation is discussed in Sect.\,\ref{sec:exp-res} followed by a concluding section.
