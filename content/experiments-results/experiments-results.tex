\section{\uppercase{Experimental Results}}
\label{sec:exp-res} 

\noindent The classification results are reported in Table~\ref{tab:tab1} using the aforementioned features, the \ac{rf} classifier and the different imbalancing techniques presented in Sect.\,\ref{sec:met}. 
Table~\ref{tab:tab1} can be divided into three main parts representing the results using imbalance data (IB), the balancing in the data space \ac{os} and the balancing in the feature space.
These strategies are separated by a double horizontal line.
The strategies performed in the feature space are subdivided into either \ac{os} or \ac{us} or a combination of \ac{os} follow by \ac{us} (see horizontal dashed line in Table~\ref{tab:tab1}).
The two highest \ac{se} for each feature set are highlighted in dark and light gray cell colors, respectively. 

The obtained results indicate that balancing techniques are essential and improve the classification performance. 
% Certainly, some techniques are more subjects to the feature representations than others. 
However, the improvements in comparison to imbalanced classification is evident. 
For this case study the \ac{us} techniques outperform the \ac{os} techniques. 
Due to the characteristics similarities of melanoma and dysplastic lesions, it is expected to have correlated feature space among melanoma and dysplastic lesions. 
Subsequently, the miss-leading samples could be removed using \ac{us} and lead to better performance.
Specifically to our purpose, \ac{nm2} is the algorithm maximizing the sensitivity and in overall, \ac{nm} algorithms perform the best on our dataset. 
However, \ac{ncr} algorithm (see results highlighted in blue in Table~\ref{tab:tab1}) achieves the best performance, considering a trade-off between \ac{se} and \ac{sp}. 
Focusing only on \ac{os} techniques, \ac{os} in data space outperforms the techniques performing in feature space.
