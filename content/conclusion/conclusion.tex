\section{\uppercase{Conclusion}}
\label{sec:cons} 

\noindent In this paper, we analyzed the impact of data balancing techniques for the classification of malignant melanoma. 
Therefore, we presented an extensive comparison of twelve \ac{os} and \ac{us} techniques in both feature and data space. 
These techniques were evaluated on the only public dermoscopic dataset, the $PH^{2}$ dataset, in order to provide a chance for future comparison.
The obtained results particularly highlight the advantage of balancing the training set over using the original data, particularly for the methods based on \ac{us} (\ac{nm2},\ac{ncr}) and combination of \ac{os} and \ac{us} in feature space.
Furthermore, \ac{os} in data space outperforms the techniques performing in the feature space.
This study also showed that combining color and texture features will lead to better performance.
