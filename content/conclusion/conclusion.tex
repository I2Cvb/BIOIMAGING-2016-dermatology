\section{\uppercase{Conclusion}}
\label{sec:cons} 

\noindent In this paper, we analyzed the impact of data balancing techniques for the classification of malignant melanoma. 
Therefore, we presented an extensive comparison of twelve \ac{os} and \ac{us} techniques in both feature and data space. 
These techniques were evaluated on a subset of $PH^{2}$ dataset with an imbalanced ration of 1:3.
{\color{red} This is the only public dermoscopic dataset available, thus provide a chance of fair comparison for future research in this line.}
The obtained results particularly highlight the advantage of balancing the training set over using the original data, particularly for the methods based on \ac{us} (\ac{rus}, \ac{nm2} and \ac{ncr}) and combination of \ac{os} and \ac{us} (\ac{smote}+\ac{tl}) in feature space.
This study also showed that combining color and texture features will lead to better performance.
